# mapper-base

## Overview

This project contains code and configurations that help resolve ... 
- Dow Jones watch lists including: Risk and Compliance and High Risk Companies
- IJIC databases including: Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, Bahamas Leaks, and Offshore Leaks
- Dun and Bradstreet databases including: Principles, Contacts, and Beneficial owners

The [base_config_updates.json](base_config_updates.json) contain features and settings that help resolve these data sources.

The [base_mapper.py](base_mapper.py) script contains code that generates these special features.  It can and is called as a library by the aforementioned higher-level mappers.   It can also be run standalone to add these special features to previously prepared json files, such as your own customer data.

The [base_variants.json](base_variants.json) contains ISO code conversion tables to states and countries. Country and state codes are standardized on this mapper to improve matching.

*Important note: The need for this project will eventually be replaced as its features and functionality are being incorporated into the Senzing API.  This project will be marked obsolete when that occurs.*

Usage:

For standalone use ...
```console
python base_mapper.py --help
usage: base_mapper.py [-h] [-i INPUT_FILE] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-l LOG_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input_file INPUT_FILE
                        name of a json file to standardize.
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
                        name of file to write updated json output to.
  -l LOG_FILE, --log_file LOG_FILE
                        optional statistics filename (json format).
```
To import as a class ...
```console
from base_mapper import base_library
baseLibrary = base_library('base_variants.json')
if not baseLibrary.initialized:
    print('base library not initialized!')
```

*Both of these approaches end up executing the jsonUpdater() function which creates additional features for matching the aforementioned data sources.*

4. [Base library class](#Base-library-class)
5. [Base variant lists](#Base-variant-lists)
5. [Optional ini file parameter](#Optional-ini-file-parameter)

### Prerequisites
- python 3.6 or higher
- Senzing API version 1.7 or higher

### Installation

Place the the following files on a directory of your choice ...
- [base_mapper.py](base_mapper.py) 
- [base_variants.json](base_variants.json)
- [base_config_updates.json](base_config_updates.json)

*Note: Since the mapper-base project referenced above is required by higher level mapper projects, it is necessary to place them in a common directory structure like so ...*
```Console
/senzing/mappers/mapper-base         <--
/senzing/mappers/mapper-ijic
/senzing/mappers/mapper-dowjones
```

### Configuring Senzing

*Note:* This only needs to be performed one time! In fact you may want to add these configuration updates to a master configuration file for all your data sources.

**If you are on version G2 API version 1.10 or prior**, update the G2ConfigTool.py program file on the /opt/senzing/g2/python directory with this one ... [G2ConfigTool.py](G2ConfigTool.py)

Then from the /opt/senzing/g2/python directory ...
```console
python3 G2ConfigTool.py <path-to-file>/base_config_updates.json
```
This will step you through the process of adding the additional features, attributes and other settings needed to resolve the aforementioned data sources with your own. After each command you will see a status message saying "success" or "already exists".  For instance, if you run the script twice, the second time through they will all say "already exists" which is OK.

Configuration updates include:

- New features and attributes for all data sources
    - **RECORD_TYPE** An exclusive feature that prevents people from resolving to organizations. (computed by base library)
    - **ISO_COUNTRY_CODE** All countries from other features are standardized into a list of these. (computed by base library)
    - **DATE_OF_DEATH** Added to default configuration, only the attribute was missing.
    - **PLACE_OF_BIRTH** Added to default configuration as contains key country information for a person.
    - **REGISTRATION_DATE** Added to default configuration key date for an organization.
    - **REGISTRATION_COUNTRY** Added to default configuration as key country information for an organization.
    - **GROUP_ASSN_ID** Like GROUP_ASSOCIATION_ORG_NAME, this feature and its attributes hold the DUNS number of the company for a DUN and Bradstreet principle, contact or owner.  The dow jones watch lists also contain associated duns numbers.ÃŸ

- **GROUP_ASSOCIATION_TYPE** is defaulted to (org) so it does not have to be mapped and will be the same across data sources.

- The following composite keys are added for internal use ... there codes are self-explanatory.
    - **CK_NAME_DOB_COUNTRY** 
    - **CK_NAME_DOB**
    - **CK_NAME_COUNTRY**
    - **CK_NAME_GROUPNAME**
    - **CK_NAME_GROUPID**

*WARNING:* the following settings are commented out as they affect performance and quality. Only use them if you understand and are OK with the effects.
- sets **NAME**, **ADDRESS** and **GROUP_ASSOCIATION** to be used for candidates. Normally just their hashes are used to find candidates.  The effect is performance is slightly degraded.
- set **distinct** off.  Normally this is on to prevent lower strength AKAs to cause matches as only the most distinct names are considered. The effect is more potential false positives.

### Base library class

The [base_mapper.py](base_mapper.py) contains the base_library class which contains the following functions ...

- **formatDate** Formats various date formats into a yyyy-mm-dd standard.
- **isoCountryCode** Takes incoming country names or codes and converts them to the ISO 2 or 3 digit standard. 
- **isoStateCode** Takes incoming state names or codes and converts them to the ISO 2 standard. 
- **isCompanyName** Uses key words to determine if a name string contains a company name rather than a person name.
- **makeNameKey** Uses codes and logic to clean person or organization names into name keys for the purpose of finding candidate matches.
- **attributeCategory** Used exclusively by the json updater to identify attributes used to create composite keys.
- **jsonUpdater** Reads a json record using the attributeCategory function to identify key attributes to standardize and use in composite keys.

### Base variant lists

The [base_variants.json](base_variants.json) contains the following lists ...

- **BAD_VALUES** A list of bad values such as "null" will will be ignored when creating composite keys. 
- **ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORIES** A grouping of standard attributes that will be used when creating composite keys. 
- **ORGANIZATION_TOKENS** A dictionary of tokens that indicate a company name. 
- **PERSON_TOKENS** A dictionary of tokens that indicate a person name.
- **STATE_CODES** A dictionary of raw values to ISO state code.
- **COUNTRY_CODES** A dictionary of raw values to ISO state code.

*Notes:*
- The organization and person tokens are also used by the makeNameKey function.  An empty value strips the token, while an included value replaces it.
- These lists are meant to be extended based on data you are seeing in your data sources.  For instance ...
    - If you find a country name or code value in your data that is not contained in the country code list go ahead and add it for better matching across data sources.
    - Different industries have different keywords in company names. You will find the word "medical" in the health care industry while the word "trust" appears often in the banking idustry.  Add the tokens for your industry that help identify companies.

### Optional ini file parameter

There is also an ini file change that can benefit watch list matching.  In the pipeline section of the main g2 ini file you use, such as the /opt/senzing/g2/python/G2Module.ini, place the following entry in the pipeline section as show below.

```console
[pipeline]
 NAME_EFEAT_WATCHLIST_MODE=Y
```

This effectively doubles the number of name hashes created which improves the chances of finding a match at the cost of performance.  Consider creating a separate g2 ini file used just for searching and include this parameter.  If you include it during the loading of data, only have it on while loading the watch list as the load time will actually more than double!
